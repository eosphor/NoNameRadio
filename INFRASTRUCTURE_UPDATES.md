# Infrastructure Updates - NoNameRadio

This document tracks major infrastructure improvements and modernization tasks completed for the NoNameRadio project.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Gradle Infrastructure Modernization

**Task**: Update Gradle infrastructure with version catalogs and centralized dependency management

**Implementation**:
- âœ… Added `gradle/libs.versions.toml` for centralized version management
- âœ… Migrated all dependency versions from `app/build.gradle` to version catalogs
- âœ… Implemented common lint configurations through `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- âœ… Added consistent code quality rules across the project

**Benefits**:
- Centralized dependency version management
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Consistent lint rules across modules
- Better build performance and caching

**Files Modified**:
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (new)
- `app/build.gradle` (updated)
- `build.gradle` (updated)

### 2. Dependency Updates (Minor Versions)

**Task**: Update dependencies to latest compatible minor versions within same major releases

**Implementation**:
- âœ… **AndroidX**: Updated to latest compatible minor versions
- âœ… **Material Design**: Updated to latest stable releases
- âœ… **Glide**: Updated to latest minor version
- âœ… **OkHttp**: Updated to latest compatible version
- âœ… **Room**: Updated to latest minor release
- âœ… **Media3**: Updated to version 1.8.0

**Safety Measures**:
- Only minor version updates (no breaking changes)
- Checked release notes for compatibility
- Verified API compatibility within same major versions
- Tested build and runtime functionality

**Benefits**:
- Latest bug fixes and performance improvements
- Security updates and patches
- Better compatibility with latest Android versions
- Improved stability and reliability
