## 🏗️ Architecture & Technical Improvements

### 🎯 **Clean Architecture Implementation**
This fork has undergone comprehensive architectural refactoring to improve maintainability and testability:

#### **Layered Architecture**:
```
📁 presentation/     # UI Controllers, Activities, Fragments
📁 core/domain/      # Business Logic, Use Cases, Interfaces
📁 core/di/          # Dependency Injection
📁 data/repository/  # Data Access Layer
📁 data/local/       # Local Storage
📁 data/remote/      # Network Operations
```

#### **Implemented Patterns**:
- **🏛️ Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear layer boundaries
- **🔌 Dependency Injection**: Centralized dependency management with DI container
- **🏭 Repository Pattern**: Abstraction over data sources for stations and recordings
- **🎭 Command Pattern**: Encapsulated player operations with undo support
- **🔄 Observer Pattern**: Reactive UI updates and state management
- **🎪 Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable implementations for different services

### 🚀 **Technical Enhancements**

#### **Modern Android Development**:
- **📱 Media3 Migration**: Complete transition to `androidx.media3` for all media playback
- **🌐 Modern Networking**: `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback` instead of deprecated broadcasts
- **🔄 Reactive Architecture**: LiveData and Observer patterns for UI state management
- **🧪 Testable Codebase**: Comprehensive unit tests with interfaces and mocks
- **⚡ Performance Optimization**: Improved memory management and background processing

#### **Code Quality Improvements**:
- **📝 Code Organization**: Specialized utility classes (`NetworkUtils`, `UiUtils`, `FormatUtils`)
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Centralized error management with `ErrorHandler` and `Result<T>` patterns
- **🔧 Build Optimization**: Gradle Kotlin DSL, optimized dependencies, R8 configuration
- **📊 Analytics**: AppMetrica integration for crash reporting and usage analytics

#### **Recording System Overhaul**:
- **⏱️ 60-Minute Limit**: Automatic recording termination after 1 hour
- **💾 MediaStore Integration**: Proper Android 10+ storage handling
- **🎵 Audio Stream Interception**: Custom `DataSource` for seamless recording
- **🗂️ Recording Management**: CRUD operations with proper file management
