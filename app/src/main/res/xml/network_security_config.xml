        Radio Streaming Application Network Security Configuration
        
        Radio streams often use HTTP (not HTTPS) for streaming audio.
        This is industry standard for internet radio broadcasting.
        
        Security considerations:
        - API calls use HTTPS (enforced in code)
        - Radio-Browser API uses HTTPS
        - Stream URLs come from trusted Radio-Browser database
        - Audio streams themselves use HTTP (legacy infrastructure)
        
        Future improvements:
        - Migrate to HTTPS streams when available
        - Implement certificate pinning for API endpoints
        - Use domain-specific rules as stream infrastructure modernizes

    <!--
        Note: We allow cleartext for radio streams compatibility.
        Most internet radio stations still use HTTP for streaming.
        The Radio-Browser API itself uses HTTPS for station lookup.
